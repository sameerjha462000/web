    <p>Many teachers are comfortable allowing their students to read for pleasure at school and encourage reading at home for pleasure too. Writing is often seen as a creative activity. Our society appreciates Literacy as having both creative and purposeful aspects. Yet mathematics as a source of enjoyment or creativity is often not considered by many. I want you to reflect on your own thinking here. How important do you see creativity in mathematics? What does creativity in mathematics even mean to you?Several years ago, Marian Small tried to help us as math teachers see what it means to think and be creative in mathematics by sharing 2 different ways for our students to experience the same content. She called them ‚Äútype 1‚Äù and ‚Äútype 2‚Äù questions. </p>

        <h1>What is COLLATZ CONJECTURE</h1>
        <p>You will be tempted. This problem is simply stated, easily understood, and all too inviting. Just pick a number, any number: If the number is even, cut it in half; if it‚Äôs odd, triple it and add 1. Take that new number and repeat the process, again and again. If you keep this up, you‚Äôll eventually get stuck in a loop. At least, that‚Äôs what we think will happen.

            Take 10 for example: 10 is even, so we cut it in half to get 5. Since 5 is odd, we triple it and add 1. Now we have 16, which is even, so we halve it to get 8, then halve that to get 4, then halve it again to get 2, and once more to get 1. Since 1 is odd, we triple it and add 1. Now we‚Äôre back at 4, and we know where this goes: 4 goes to 2 which goes to 1 which goes to 4, and so on. We‚Äôre stuck in a loop.
            
            Or try 11: It‚Äôs odd, so we triple it and add 1. Now we have 34, which is even, so we halve it to get 17, triple that and add 1 to get 52, halve that to get 26 and again to get 13, triple that and add 1 to get 40, halve that to get 20, then 10, then 5, triple that and add 1 to get 16, and halve that to get 8, then 4, 2 and 1. And we‚Äôre stuck in the loop again.

            The infamous <span style="color: blue;"><strong> Collatz conjecture </strong></span> says that if you start with any positive integer, you‚Äôll always end up in this loop. And you‚Äôll probably ignore my warning about trying to solve it: It just seems too simple and too orderly to resist understanding. In fact, it would be hard to find a mathematician who hasn‚Äôt played around with this problem.
